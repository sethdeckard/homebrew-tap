# Homebrew cask template for deviceterm. `version` and `sha256` are
# placeholders: `scripts/publish-release.sh` renders this into the tap
# (sethdeckard/homebrew-tap → Casks/deviceterm.rb) at release time,
# filling `version` from DeviceTermVersion.swift and `sha256` from the
# notarized DMG. Don't hand-edit the copy in the tap; edit this
# template and re-run the publish step.
#
# Install:  brew install --cask sethdeckard/tap/deviceterm
