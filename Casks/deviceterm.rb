# Homebrew cask for deviceterm — source of truth, versioned with the app.
#
# `scripts/publish-release.sh` renders this into the tap
# (sethdeckard/homebrew-tap → Casks/deviceterm.rb) at release time,
# refreshing `version` + `sha256` from the notarized DMG. Don't hand-edit
# the copy in the tap; edit this template and re-run the publish step.
#
# Install:  brew install --cask sethdeckard/tap/deviceterm
